* Add support for series Name in the config
** The name would be displayable
** ID is for internal stuff
* Multiple series selection
* Proper handling of beginning/end of the series
** Right now it seems like we just rotate sometimes
** That's not really great
** If we're at the beginning, we should say "No previous show"
** IF we're at the end: "Reached the end"
** Or maybe just set the "previous" and "next" buttons to the same show?
* Add license
** Needs to be GPL 3 because of FBS and Qt
* Add keyboard accelerators
* Edit config from the app
** Ideas:
*** Adding a new series
*** Removing a series
*** Setting the currently-played episode
*** Changing the directory for a series
*** Adding a local directory for a series
