* Prevent double-clicking on the "Play next episode" button
** Fucking Windows teaching people to double-click
** Anyway, after clicking, the button should be disabled for a bit
*** say 3 seconds?
*** To prevent the video taking a sec or two to start?
* Set up Windows CI
** So we get automatic builds
** AppVeyor
*** Windows and Linux (no macOS)
https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-environment/
*** Supports gitlab:
https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2018/11/06/gitlab-bitbucket-merge-pull-requests/
*** Should be fine for this
** Travis CI
*** Windows, Linux & macOS
*** Does not (AFAICT) supprot gitlab
** Azure pipelines
*** Windows, Linux, macOS
https://azure.microsoft.com/ru-ru/blog/announcing-azure-pipelines-with-unlimited-ci-cd-minutes-for-open-source/
*** Supports gitlab

* Add an About dialog
* Credit the icon we're using
https://icons8.com/icon/46904/cute-color
** It needs to be linked to from the About dialog
** E.g.
<a href="https://icons8.com/icon/46904/tv-show">TV Show icon by Icons8</a>
* Make the "File Not Found" button text red
* Proper handling of beginning/end of the series
** Right now it seems like we just rotate sometimes
** That's not really great
** If we're at the beginning, we should say "No previous show"
** IF we're at the end: "Reached the end"
** Or maybe just set the "previous" and "next" buttons to the same show?
* Handle config changing from under us
** When the config files can by synced, we should detect that before overwriting
* Add a file extension whitelist
** So we don't attempt to play e.g. subtitles, cover art etc.
* Add keyboard accelerators
* Use proper toml parser
** We say the file is toml but we parse it as ini
** I'm pretty sure it's not actually valid toml (it's missing quotes for the strings)
** Here's a Python toml library
https://pypi.org/project/toml/
* Edit config from the app
** Ideas:
*** Adding a new series
*** Removing a series
*** Setting the currently-played episode
*** Changing the directory for a series
*** Adding a local directory for a series
