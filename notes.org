* Proper handling of beginning/end of the series
** Right now it seems like we just rotate sometimes
** That's not really great
** If we're at the beginning, we should say "No previous show"
** IF we're at the end: "Reached the end"
** Or maybe just set the "previous" and "next" buttons to the same show?
* Mandle multi-directory series
** E.g. files with the following structure:
Show/
- S01/
  - e01.avi
  - e02.avi
- S02/
  - e01.avi
  - e02.avi
* Make the "watch the last show" functionality less prominent?
** Right now, the obvious "Play Next" button is only slightly bigger
** But that's the entire raison d'etre of this app
** And I've seen users mistakenly clicking the "prev show" button instead
** We could replace the "prev show" button
*** maybe with a link?
*** or a dropdown?
** Move the "Play next" button up
*** make it bigger
*** make the font bigger
* Make the "File Not Found" button text red and disabled
* Show error msgbox on missing config
** Or create an empty one
* Add some test config and test data
* Handle config changing from under us
** When the config files can by synced, we should detect that before overwriting
* Add a file extension whitelist
** So we don't attempt to play e.g. subtitles, cover art etc.
* Add keyboard accelerators
* Use proper toml parser
** We say the file is toml but we parse it as ini
** I'm pretty sure it's not actually valid toml (it's missing quotes for the strings)
** Here's a Python toml library
https://pypi.org/project/toml/
* Edit config from the app
